# Description for the scripts.
There is a simple rule to make a script we have to choose a specific line to define that the script will be executed using bash for example.
#### Examples for typically Shebang lines:
* Execute the file using Bourne shell:
```
#!/bin/sh
```
* Execute the file using Bash shell (In this task we will use this one):
```
#!/bin/bash
```
* Execute the file using PowerShell:
```
#!/usr/bin/pwsh
```
* Execute the file using a Python interpreter:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
